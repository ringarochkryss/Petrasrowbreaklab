Printing a table from a webapp is not as easy as it looks. My team got it to work in Firefox but not i Chrome.
After a lot of tips from collegues around the web, here is a working example. 

[Have a look](https://ringarochkryss.github.io/Petrasrowbreaklab/).
- [x] Page break simple Divs
- [x] Page break for block element in the middle of a table
- [ ] Adjust Css to compensate for lack of Bootstrap and floating
```
